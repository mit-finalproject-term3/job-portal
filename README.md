# Term 3 - Major Project (Job Portal)

## Team Members:
Kasumi Takeshima
Reena Patil
Sana Joshi
Ali Asgari

## Project Briefing
We would like to propose a custom job portal which the company can use to advertise available positions and accept applications from prospective candidates. I believe that this proposed job portal will allow the company to maintain all its job openings on a single platform which would be exposed via the website and also it will allow the candidate applications to be seamlessly managed.
